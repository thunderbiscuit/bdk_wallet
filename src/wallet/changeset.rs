/// A change set for [`Wallet`].
///
/// ## Definition
///
/// The change set is responsible for transmitting data between the persistent storage layer and the
/// core library components. Specifically, it serves two primary functions:
///
/// 1) Recording incremental changes to the in-memory representation that need to be persisted to
///    disk
/// 2) Applying aggregate changes from the persistence layer to the in-memory representation at
///    startup
///
/// ## Contract
///
/// The change set maintains and enforces the following properties:
///
/// * Change sets must implement [`Serialize`] and [`Deserialize`] to meet the definition from
///   above.
/// * Change sets must implement [`Default`] as a way of instantiating new empty objects.
/// * Change sets must implement [`Merge`] so that many instances can be aggregated into a single
///   instance.
/// * A change set is composed of a number of individual "sub-change sets" that adhere to the same
///   rules as above. This is for increased modularity and portability. For example the core modules
///   each have their own change set (`tx_graph`, `local_chain`, etc).
///
/// ## Members and required fields
///
/// The change set has certain required fields without which a [`Wallet`] cannot function.
/// These include the [`descriptors`] and the [`bitcoin::Network`] in use. These are required to be
/// non-empty *in the aggregate*, meaning the field must be present and non-null in the union of all
/// persisted changes, but may be empty in any one change set, where "empty" is defined by the
/// [`Merge`](Merge::is_empty) implementation of that change set. This requirement also applies to
/// the [`local_chain`] field in that the aggregate change set must include a genesis block.
///
/// For example, the [`descriptors`] and [`bitcoin::Network`] are present in the first change set
/// after wallet creation, but are usually omitted in subsequent updates, as they are not permitted
/// to change at any point thereafter.
///
/// Other fields of the change set are not required to be non-empty, that is they may be empty even
/// in the aggregate. However, in practice they should contain the data needed to recover a wallet
/// state between sessions. These include:
/// * [`tx_graph`](Self::tx_graph)
/// * [`indexer`](Self::indexer)
///
/// A keychain may be introduced by a later change set — a wallet can start tracking a new one at
/// any time — but the descriptor bound to a keychain is fixed at the point that keychain first
/// appears, and must be identical in every change set thereafter.
///
/// ## Staging
///
/// For greater efficiency the [`Wallet`] is able to *stage* the to-be-persisted changes. Many
/// operations result in staged changes which require persistence on the part of the user. These
/// include address revelation, applying an [`Update`], and introducing transactions and chain
/// data to the wallet. To get the staged changes see [`Wallet::staged`] and similar methods. Once
/// the changes are committed to the persistence layer the contents of the stage should be
/// discarded.
///
/// Users should persist early and often generally speaking, however in principle there is no
/// limit to the number or type of changes that can be staged prior to persisting or the order in
/// which they're staged. This is because change sets are designed to be [merged]. The change
/// that is ultimately persisted will encompass the combined effect of each change individually.
///
/// ## Extensibility
///
/// Existing fields may be extended in the future with additional sub-fields. New top-level fields
/// are likely to be added as new features and core components are implemented. Existing fields may
/// be removed in future versions of the library following the deprecation policy below.
///
/// ## Version Compatibility
///
/// Any change to the [`ChangeSet`] data structure MUST correlate with a major version bump per
/// [Semantic Versioning]. We guarantee that version N can read and
/// deserialize [`ChangeSet`] data written by version N-1 (one major version back), but this
/// guarantee does NOT extend to version N-2 or earlier. New fields added in version N must
/// implement [`Default`] so that when reading N-1 data, absent fields are populated with default
/// values.
///
/// Limited forward compatibility is provided for downgrades: version N-1 will successfully
/// deserialize version N data without errors by ignoring unknown fields. Users should be aware that
/// features introduced in version N will not be available when downgrading to N-1, and that
/// downgrading can result in loss of data if not backed up. For this reason we recommend carefully
/// planning major upgrades and backing up necessary data to avoid compatibility issues.
///
/// Fields can be removed using a 3-version deprecation cycle: fields are marked deprecated in
/// version N with a reason and instructions for migrating, the field is retained in version N+1
/// for compatibility where it deserializes but may not be used, and finally removed in version
/// N+2. This ensures the standard backwards compatibility guarantees while allowing the removal of
/// deprecated fields.
///
/// ### Responsibilities
///
/// Library authors SHOULD test all upgrade paths using the persistence test suite and in CI.
/// Library authors MUST document API changes prominently in the release notes and CHANGELOG,
/// clearly mark deprecated fields including migration instructions, and follow the 3-version
/// deprecation cycle before removing fields.
///
/// Users SHOULD back up wallet data before major version upgrades, test upgrades in non-production
/// environments first, and monitor the release notes for warnings and updates. Users MUST complete
/// migrations within the compatibility window, and not skip major versions (i.e. upgrade major
/// versions sequentially).
///
/// ### Custom Persistence Implementations
///
/// The resulting interface is designed to give the user more control of what to persist and when
/// to persist it. Custom implementations should consider and account for the possibility of
/// partial or repeat writes, the atomicity of persistence operations, and the order of reads and
/// writes among the fields of the change set. BDK comes with support for [SQLite] that handles
/// the details for you and is recommended for many users. If implementing your own persistence,
/// please refer to the documentation for [`WalletPersister`] and [`PersistedWallet`] for more
/// information.
