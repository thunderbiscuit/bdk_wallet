# Multi-keychain examples

A `Wallet<K>` tracks any number of keychains, each identified by a value of type `K`. The default
is `KeychainKind`, which gives the familiar two-keychain wallet; supplying your own `K` gives you
as many keychains as you need.

The wallet requires `K: Ord + Clone + Debug` and nothing more, so `K` can carry whatever metadata
your application wants to attach to a keychain. `Ord` is required because keychains are held in a
`BTreeMap`, which also means it decides the order they iterate in.

| Example | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| [`custom_keychain.rs`](./custom_keychain.rs) | A keychain identifier that carries application metadata, and using it to choose which keychain to reveal from |
| [`address_generation.rs`](./address_generation.rs) | Per-keychain derivation indices, `reveal_next_address` vs `next_unused_address`, reading back the last revealed index |
| [`persistence.rs`](./persistence.rs) | Persisting a multi-keychain wallet to sqlite and loading it back, including load-time descriptor checks |

Run them with:

```shell
cargo run --example multi_keychain_custom_keychain
cargo run --example multi_keychain_address_generation
cargo run --example multi_keychain_persistence --features rusqlite
```

## Building a wallet

Descriptors go into a `KeyRing`, which validates each one against the network and rejects duplicate
keychains and duplicate descriptors as they are added:

```rust,ignore
let mut keyring = KeyRing::new(Network::Signet, Keychain::A, DESC_A)?;
keyring.add_descriptor(Keychain::B, DESC_B)?;

let mut wallet = Wallet::create(keyring).create_wallet_no_persist();
```

Because the `KeyRing` has already done that checking, building the wallet from it cannot fail —
`create_wallet_no_persist` returns a `Wallet<K>` rather than a `Result`. Descriptor errors surface
at `KeyRing::new` and `KeyRing::add_descriptor`, where the descriptor was actually supplied.

For the standard two-keychain wallet, `KeyRing::standard` is the shorthand:

```rust,ignore
let keyring = KeyRing::standard(Network::Signet, external_desc, internal_desc)?;
```

## Current limitations

One thing a multi-keychain wallet cannot do yet:

- **No transaction building.** `TxBuilder` lives on `impl Wallet<KeychainKind>`, because building a
  transaction has to pick a change keychain and a wallet generic over `K` has no canonical one.
  Relatedly, `balance()` counts nothing as trusted until it is mined.

To persist a custom keychain type, implement `rusqlite`'s `ToSql` and `FromSql` for it (see
[`persistence.rs`](./persistence.rs)); for the file store, implement `serde::Serialize` and
`serde::Deserialize`.
